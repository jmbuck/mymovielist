# My Movie List

## About
My Movie List is a React-powered web app that gives users a lightweight and simple way to keep track of all the movies they've seen. It implements a scoring system and calculates statistics such as total runtime and mean score based on your movie lists.

The website uses the TMDB API to get all its movie data. The API can be found [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/).
Firebase is used to store user data.

## Setup
After cloning, run `npm install` in the project directory

Copy the `keys.example.js` file to a separate `keys.js` file and fill in the needed information for the Firebase API and the TMDB API
